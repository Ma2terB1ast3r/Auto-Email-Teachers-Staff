        <h2>How is this innovative?</h2>
        <p>There was a need for this software to be developed because there is a pandemic currently and people are missing school for a week because of it. And as a result, miss important school work and fall behind. This is where our software come into play, our software allows users to imput their classes into a CSV file, with their teachers name and class that they missed, and then the script will read the CSV file and substitute the values which are stored in the File to an email, with other text and send it to all of the teachers with one click of a button. </p>

        <h2>enviroment</h2>
        <p>we pretend to care about the enviroment by including pictures of trees and working from home. in reality we just wanted to use our own computer so we could use a keyboard that wasnt the cheapest thing available to buy in bulk, so uhhh yeah place holder text, uhh have the anatomy of a dolphin. Dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head; they lack external ear flaps. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10 t (11 short tons) orca. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other Cetartiodactyls. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. Dolphins have conical teeth, as opposed to porpoises' spade-shaped teeth.</p>
