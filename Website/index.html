        <p>This python based script connects to microsoft's exchange server which is what the school uses to give us our emails. and soon it will take information from a CSV file with the names and emails of teachers that you had on the day that you were away, and email them some generic "hey i was sick this day please send me the work i need to catch up on. </p>

        <h2>enviroment</h2>
        <p>we pretend to care about the enviroment by including pictures of trees and working from home. in reality we just wanted to use our own computer so we could use a keyboard that wasnt the cheapest thing available to buy in bulk, so uhhh yeah place holder text, uhh have the anatomy of a dolphin. Dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head; they lack external ear flaps. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10 t (11 short tons) orca. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other Cetartiodactyls. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. Dolphins have conical teeth, as opposed to porpoises' spade-shaped teeth.</p>
